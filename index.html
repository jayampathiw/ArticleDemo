                                <p>Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, has a long history as a port on ancient east-west trade
                                    routes, ruled successively by the Portuguese, Dutch and British. That heritage is reflected
                                    in its its architecture, mixing colonial buildings with high-rises and shopping malls.
                                    The imposing Colombo National Museum, dedicated to Sri Lankan history, borders sprawling
                                    Viharamahadevi Park and its giant Buddha.</p>
